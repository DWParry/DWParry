- 👋 Hi, I’m @DWParry
- 👀 I’m interested in using micropython on Pi Pico's to run a bunch of sensors,
- and python/mariaSQL/Grafana/nginx on a Pi3 to record and publish their output.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning this and everything else
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on telemetering solar installation (EPever MPPT), LifePO4 batteries, BMC1500 engine,
- and various other things in and around the boat
- 📫 How to reach me - can you leave a message on this?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm currently torn between filling this in and watching who's winning in the eternal war between the
- local coots and everyone else.
